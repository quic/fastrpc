/**
 * Process local storage is local storage for the hlos process context.
 *
 * Warning, this API should only be called from within a thread started
 * by FastRPC, and not from any user created threads via the qurt apis.
 *
 * When used from within a FastRPC started thread this will attach
 * desturctors to the lifetime of the HLOS process that is making the
 * rpc calls.  Users can use this to store context for the lifetime of
 * the calling process on the hlos.
 *
 * Recovering instances
 * --------------------
 *
 * To maintain the same instance structure for a caller from the HLOS
 * users can use the HAP_pls_add_lookup api, which will lookup the key,
 * and add it if its not already present. For example:
 *
 *    static int my_instance(struct my_struct* me)  {
 *       return HAP_pls_add_lookup((uintptr_t)my_ctor,   //type, some
 * unique static address 0,                //key, for different type
 * instances sizeof(*me),      //size of our struture my_ctor,
 * //structure ctor 0,                //aditional user context for ctor
 *                                  my_dtor,          //desturctor
 *                                  &me);             //result
 *    }
 *
 * First call to my_instance will initialize the structure by
 * allocating it and calling my_ctor. Second call to my_instance will
 * return the created instance. This API is thread safe, but when two
 * threads try to intialize the structure the first time they may both
 * create an instance, but only 1 will be returned. The destructor will
 * be called when the HLOS process exits.
 *
 * See HAP_pls_add and HAP_pls_add_lookup.
 *
 * Exit Hooks
 * ----------
 *
 * Users can use either HAP_pls_add_lookup or HAP_pls_add to add a
 * destructor that will be called when the HLOS process exits.  The
 * main difference between the two functions is that HAP_pls_add will
 * always add, and the last instance added will be the one returned by
 * HAP_pls_lookup.
 *
