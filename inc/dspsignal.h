    Internal FastRPC CPU-DSP signaling API.

    dspsignals are low-level userspace to userspace signals intended to be used
    as building blocks for client-visible inter-processor communication
    constructs. The key properties are:

    - 32-bit per-process signal identifiers, grouped into address
      spaces for different applications. Clients are responsible for
      managing their signal numbers.

    - Power efficient interrupt-based signaling. The implementation
      does not use shared memory polling or similar constructs -
      sending a signal involves triggering an interrupt on the
      receiving endpoint. This results in some key secondary
      properties:

        - Frameworks that aim for lower possible latency should use
          shared memory polling, WFE, or other similar mechanisms as
          the fast path and dspsignals as the longer-latency
          power-efficient fallback mechanism when appropriate.

        - Signaling latency is typically comparable to (but lower
          than) 50% of synchronous FastRPC call latency without
          polling.

        - Signaling latency will vary widely depending on the
          low-power modes the endpoints can use. Clients can influence
          this through DSP power voting and CPU PM QoS settings.

    - Reliable signal delivery. Every signal will eventually be
      delivered to the other endpoint and clients are not expected to
      implement retry loops.

    - Multiple instances of the same signal may get coalesced into
      one. In other words, if the signal sender calls dspsignal_send()
      multiple times in the loop, the client may see fewer
      dspsignal_wait() calls complete. It will however see at least
      one wait call complete after the last send call returns.

    - Signals may be delivered out of order

    - Clients may receive stale or spurious signals after reusing a
      signal ID. Due to this clients should not assume a specific
      event happened when receiving a signal, but should use another
      mechanism such as a shared memory structure to confirm it
      actually did.

    The signal APIs are intended for internal FastRPC use only.

    On process or subsystem restart the CPU client must destroy all
    signal instances and re-create them as needed.

    The CPU client process is expected to have an existing FastRPC
    session with the target DSP before creating signals. On the DSP
    signals can only be used in FastRPC user PDs.
