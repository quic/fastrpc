/**
 * Write an early wakeup packet to the queue. Early wakeup packets are used
 * to bring the recipient out of a low-power state in anticipation of a real
 * message packet being availble shortly, and are typically used from the DSP
 * to signal that an operation is almost complete.
 *
 * This function will return immediately if the queue is full. There is no
 * blocking variant of this function; if the queue is full the other endpoint
 * should already be processing data and an early wakeup would not be useful.
 *
 * When this function is called on a multi-domain queue, early wakeup
 * is done on all the domains that the queue was created on.
 *
 * @param [in] queue Queue handle from dspqueue_create() or dspqueue_import()
 * @param [in] wakeup_delay Wakeup time in microseconds; this indicates how soon
 *                     the real message packet should be available. Zero if not known.
 *                     The recipient can use this information to determine how to
 *                     wait for the packet.
 * @param [in] packet_flags Flags for the upcoming packet if known.
 *                    The recipient can use this information to determine how to
 *                    wait for the packet. See enum #dspqueue_packet_flags
 *
 * @return 0 on success, error code on failure.
 *         - AEE_EWOULDBLOCK: The queue is full

/**
 * Retrieve statistics from a queue. Statistics are relative to the queue
 * as viewed from the current endpoint (e.g. "read queue" refers to the
 * queue as being read by the current endpoint).
 *
 * Reading an accumulating statistic (such as early wakeup wait time)
 * will reset it to zero.
 *
 * Note that statistics values are only valid at the time when they're
 * read.  By the time this function returns the values may have
 * changed due to actions from another thread or the other queue
 * endpoint.
